Firstly I want you to understand that, I dont always like to read for fun. nor should you. because as far as I am concenred it's not your fault that you can't read well. It's your teachers' fault for not teaching you well. But what can we do about it? None! That's right, the education system has failed us a long time ago. How can we fight the system you may ask? We can't! Because we are in the system!
